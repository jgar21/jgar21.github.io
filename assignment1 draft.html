	In activity one I learned the internet basics which was something was talked about in previous NET classes I have attended. The technologies and connectivity were interesting and a good review. Internet connectivity was the much needed review and I was able to familiarize myself more with terms. For activity two it covered the basics of applications, functions, and shortcuts with some of the peripherals. Applications can be an umbrella term that can be applied to more than just apps you get from the App Store. They can also be on a computer so the term is not exclusive to smart phones. File extensions was a new term for me but I understood the meaning immediately once I saw what terms it deals with. Downloading and uploading files I was certainly familiar with, along with the keyboard and mouse shortcuts. Activity three dealt with documents and files and how to save, copy or organize all things I am familiar with. 
	Activity four covered working with files but in different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Windows and Mac I am well versed in but the Linux operating system I have not used very often so it is all mostly new to me. In activity five the topic was IP addresses. While I knew that IP addresses were capable in aiding Geolocation I did not know its limits and capabilities. While I was able to get my IPv4 which is 24.15.173.175, neither website was able to get my IPv6 address, my Geolocation was Chicago, IL. For activity six the task was to become acquainted with tracert, used in Windows, and traceroute, used in Mac. I have used tracert before but have not on a Mac. For the final activity it was to familiarize yourself with Git. I have not used Git before learned how to navigate and the basics of using it. I created a repository and familiarized with the steps as it was my first time.
