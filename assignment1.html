<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p>In activity one I learned the internet basics which was something was talked about in previous NET classes I have attended. The technologies and connectivity were interesting and a good review. Internet connectivity was a much needed review and I was able to familiarize myself more with terms. I did not know about the internets history and how it came to be. It was also interesting to read about the different types of internets that are available, their cons, and how they were replaced with a better version.</p>
<p>For activity two it covered the basics of applications, functions, and shortcuts with some of the peripherals. Applications can be an umbrella term that can be applied to more than just apps you get from the App Store. They can also be on a computer so the term is not exclusive to smart phones. File extensions was a new term for me but I understood the meaning immediately once I saw what terms it deals with. Downloading and uploading files I was certainly familiar with, along with most of the keyboard and mouse shortcuts. While I grew up using Windows and have a good knowledge of the short cuts I am still fairly new to macOS and do not know the short cuts. The Mac short cuts will certainly come in handy in the future for personal use and professional use.</p>
<p>In activity five the topic was IP addresses. While I knew what IP addresses were and that IP addresses were capable of aiding in Geolocation I did not know its limits and capabilities. Geolocating can aid in crime and identify the origin of malicious malware or malicious intent. While I was able to get my IPv4 which is 24.15.173.175, neither website was able to get my IPv6 address, my Geolocation was Chicago, IL</p>
