<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
<p>The first activity dealt with the basics and introductions of search engines. It feels like Google has always been around. It has always been the standard for search engines and the one most commonly used so I am most familiar with. Other search engines have followed a similar model as Google and have the same basic functions. The tutorial had great tips on searching safe and how to identify the type of websites. Internet safety is something stressed in this field.</p>
<p>In activity two I learned what different results each search engine gives you when you search “web search engine”. It could just be because I am most used to Google, but I felt it was the best user interface. The results were to the point, and everything else was easily accessible. Bing, I did not like very much, it has more customization options than the average search engine but the results were not as accurate. Yahoo was the same as Bing and they pulled up the same results. Yahoo has a good homepage that has many sections from entertainment to news. The Ask search engine is definitely the most neglected with not a lot of use. The page is blank and very minimalistic with the results not very precise. Using Google to look up the search engine market share, it is clear that Google has the highest market share. According to statcounter.com Google has 93.12% of the shares. Bing is second as the most used search engine likely due to the fact it is the default search engine in Windows.</p>
<p>In activity six I was tasked with creating a citation from a Wikiversity page. The page I selected was the reading Search Engines. There are multiple style options available such as APA, MLA, MHRA, Chicago style, CBE/CSE, Bluebook, and BibTex. For the most part each style displays the same information but in different order or date format, the URL remains the same with the some of the font being different than the others. The exception to this is Bluebook style which does not have the exact time it was retrieved.</p>
