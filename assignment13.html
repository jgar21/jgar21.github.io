<h1>Assignment 13</h1>
<p>Personalizing is one of my favorite things to do when I get something new. Creating this website is no different and Assignment thirteen helped me even further understand what else can be done. I am still very new to this and going through the readings and activities, but my JavaScript designs are still simple and lacking a little more detail. Displaying the date was interesting as it did not require specific code to produce the current date. You just had to specify a new date and JavaScript would auto generate it to match the current date and time zone. On the personalization aspect this assignment was enlightening and will be useful information in a future career.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const d = new Date();
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d;
</script>

</body>
