<p>Assignment fifteen dealt with the creation of a Gantt Chart which prior to this I had never heard of. This type of chart aids in maintaining and tracking time management for a project. I learned there were many ways to produce one and various templates. I selected the Excel template as it was easily accessible and then learned how to format it to meet the Gantt Chart criteria. The Gantt Chart will be a useful tool for future projects to help manage my time and track how long it took to produce, which will help with time estimations for future projects as well.</p>
