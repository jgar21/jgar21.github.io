<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p>Assignment fourteen proved to be far more challenging for me than previous assignments. I had a very hard time figuring out how to create a database as it took a separate software to create one to add to the repository. Microsoft Excel could be used to create a database, so I started there and created an example list. The tutorials aided in how altering of the code could pull up the different information to display. The one I had most difficulty with was INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. After completing the tutorials, I had still had trouble comprehending despite also doing the activities.</p>
