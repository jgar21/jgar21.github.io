<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
<p>Activity three had me verify my internet connectivity through my MacBook Air. My connection is wireless, and I was able to check my connectivity through my Wi-Fi settings and verified I was connected. Next, I had to verify my IP address by accessing my System Preferences. Using this I was able to see my computers IP address as well as my routerâ€™s IP address. After that I was tasked to do a ping test. You can do this by going to Applications, then Utilities to enter the Terminal app. You type Ping and a space followed by your IP address or domain. To use Tracert on my mac it is similar to Pinging, and you go to the same applications and type traceroute followed by a space and then the website or IP address. From there it will show you where the website is based. All of these tests and verifications will be useful in the future to obtain important information about a PC or system.</p>
<p>Next, in activity four I learned how to create a shared file between two mac users. First you turn on File Sharing, followed by selecting the add button at the bottom of the shared folder and then you can add which user can have access to the folder. From there the public folders of each user on the Mac will be shared automatically. This is very useful knowledge for future use, not just for personal but for future career and helping computers be more connected and share work.</p>
<p>Finally, in activity seven I learned about the components necessary for a home network. Most modern households have a wireless network set up but many of these components are set up by a technician so this is valuable information to know. For starters you need a ISP or internet service provider, there are many options on the market with varying speeds and prices. You will also need a modem which receives from your ISP and then sends it to a Router which creates the wireless network allowing multiple devices to connect. The connection between the devices is made possible by ethernet cables and possible coaxial cable depending on the Modem. This is crucial information and basis to troubleshooting issues in the future.</p>
