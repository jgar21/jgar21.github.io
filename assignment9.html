<h1>Assignment 9</h1>
<p>Assignment nine was a lot more of a learning curve for me as it was all new material to me. I explored GitHub before but had not put it into use this way. I learned how to set up titles, heads, body, and paragraphs. I was confused about how to get to .dev until I realized I just change the address and it would take you to the editor. I had some trouble trying to figure out how to get it validated and I hope I did it correctly and if not I look forward to a correction and better understanding. This assignment has been the most enlightening to me so far as it showed my what GitHub is capable of and this is barely the minimum about what it can be used for. I am looking forward to further diving into it in this course.</p>
