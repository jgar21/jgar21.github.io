<h1>Assignment 6</h1>
<p>The first activity of lesson 15 was very insightful in career and future planning. The tutorial showed me there are many things to consider when perusing a career such as health care benefits, how to go about searching, and negotiating salary. Benefits are something that should be taught more often to young adults joining the work force. It is a very vital part of looking for a career as health care in the United States is absurdly expensive. Job fairs that were mentioned in the tutorial was not something I considered when it comes to career searching. Many jobs offers are posted online in modern day so a job fair was not something considered but will keep in mind for future endeavors. Salary negotiations I have not personally dealt with. The tutorial taught me to research average salary of the selected career and negotiate from there. The Career Planning Worksheet was also a useful tool to put goals and objectives on paper.</p>
<p>Activity two had me research jobs and their salary, educational requirements, expected growth, and my interest in them. The career I have an interest in is Network and Computer Systems Administrations. I learned that the median pay is $80,600 per year and the education requirements is typically a bachelor’s gegree but some may only require an associate’s degree. The expected job growth surprised me and saw it was a little slower than average. Certifications are an important part to many jobs. Many of the ones listed are interesting and worth looking into. The ones that stood out to me the most were CompTIA, Adobe, Google, Cisco, and Microsoft. The one I focused on the most was Google as I had heard good things about it and can be used towards a job with the company if you have the proper credentials.</p>
<p>In activity three I was tasked with creating a LinkedIn profile. I did not have a LinkedIn account before, so I had to make one from scratch. It was all a learning experience seeing how LinkedIn was and how it had a more mature feel than other social media sites. Creating my profile was simple and simple to use. Inputting my information such as experience, previous employers, and education was simple and done in steps when setting up. I look forward to using the profile in my future endeavors.</p>
