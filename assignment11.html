<p>Assignment ten was a lot less of a learning curve compared to the previous assignment. I enjoyed exploring the colors and even reading the tutorials about what all was possible and how to add it. Once I understood we are adding more code into the existing code it made it a lot easier to edit the code and add what was required. Figuring out what colors and font sizes work best was very interesting. For the sake of staying on the assignment path I didnâ€™t stray from the directions, but I am excited to apply future lessons and see what we can create.</p>
