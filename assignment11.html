<p>Assignment eleven was definitely very interesting. It was interesting in the sense that I started using two new programs which are Gimp and Inkscape. Gimp was used to create the raster image while Inkscape was for the vector graphic. Gimp was a little confusing to use at first as not everything is labeled, or some options are within another function. After much exploration I was able to dip my toe in the water and create a basic raster. Vector graphics in Inkscape was much simpler to use and provided instant shapes and colors. Inkscape and vector felt like the more refined version. Audio and multimedia provided much insight in how a video or video link can be added to a website to aid in its purpose. This assignment provided helpful information in what can be considered one of the “meat and potatoes” in a website and I look forward to becoming more proficient.</p>
