In activity one of Lesson five I was asked to name a social media site from a list provided that interests me. As a twenty seven year old I was a young teen when modern social media sites began to gain popularity. At the time the big three that people had were MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Myspace eventually declined and Facebookâ€™s, numbers rose so I have always been familiar with it and Twitter as well. The social media that interests me the most would have to be Google+. Google+ interests me because I have not used it and I use Google services for almost everything, my calendar and email are the two services I use the most. 
	Activity three of lesson five had me evaluate social media sites support the honeycomb framework. Facebook supports the whole honeycomb model with it covering identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. I had not heard of the framework before and it was interesting to know that there is some sort of criteria for a social media site. Instagram is also owned by Facebook and checks out the framework. Next Linkedin is more for networking purposes but still falls under a social media platform. Being that it is the more mature site out of the list it meets all the honeycomb frameworks. Pinterest did not meet all the criteria, specifically in presence, as it serves as a content curation platform, and reputation due to it not being emphasized. I was surprised when Reddit met the framework criteria as it is a site with a wide use. 
	In activity two of lesson six I took an interest in WhatsApp. I was pleased to know that WhatsApp is the most used of communication in Mexico and I have family there. I downloaded the app and made an account using my email and phone number. I was then able to add my family members through their phone numbers. The app made it very easy and convenient to communicate with family members in a different country using texts, calling, and even video calling. It will be very beneficial and useful in the future.
