In activity one the basics of a web browser were touched upon. While the web browser is something used every day not many people know how it works and why it works the way it does. I did not know about some of the other web browsers listed in the tutorial such as Netscape Navigator, Opera, Sea Monkey, and K-meleon. The other web browsers on the list I was much more familiar with. Many of them I knew how to navigate and use, with many of them having similar layouts and functions. The internet tips were a good refresher and covered topics in the previous NET classes.

Activity two dealt with installing different internet browsers and compare them. I already had Google Chrome and Firefox installed. The comparison between the two is they are similar in function and layout but of course Chrome works better with Google and its applications. Google Chrome also seems to be slightly faster than Firefox on my MacBook. Microsoft Edge is not very reminiscent of its predecessor Explorer, Edge works very well and does not crash like the former frequently did. The Brave and Opera browsers were new to me. Brave had similarities in feel and look to Google Chrome. It has the same extension library as Google Chrome as well further adding to the likeness. Opera also had similar look and function to Google Chrome and was very user friendly to use.

Finally for activity three it was using the web browsers and familiarizing. I have used many of the browsers for many years with the exception of a few. On my previous laptop I used Microsoft Edge and enjoyed how it kept a similar style to the old Internet Explorer I grew up using but it ditched all the crashing. My current laptop is a MacBook Air and came with Safari, but I downloaded Chrome because it is easiest to use with Google accounts. I was able to retain all my saved passwords and most settings. Before making the switch to Edge and then to Chrome I would use Firefox. Firefox was always very user friendly and to navigate. For the Opera browser it was a new experience but getting around was not too difficult. It had a similar layout to Chrome as well as similar performance. Using all these browsers and how they function will be valuable information for the future in the career.
