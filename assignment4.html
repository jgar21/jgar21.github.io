<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
<p>Activity one had me complete tutorials on the basics of emails. Email is something that many people of adult age have been around most of their life. I am no exception and am very familiar with email and what it can provide and do. One feature I do not use very often myself is the calendar feature. I did not know that it can be used in a planner style that can mark down events hourly rather than just marking days. I personally have not had to deal with professional emails very often, but I did not know the proper introductions and structure.</p>
<p>Activity two dealt with sending emails and email accounts. I use multiple email services with the primary being Outlook. The tutorial was a great refresher on some of the capabilities most email providers have such as font changes and style. Using Microsoft Outlook, I selected New Mail to compose a new e-mail. The options highlighted in the tutorial are also available in Microsoft Outlook. I sent an email to my cousin, and it was sent and received in a timely manner form one provider to another.</p>
<p>Finally in activity three I was introduced to Mozilla Thunderbird. I have not used or heard of Thunderbird before this, so it was all a new experience. Obtaining the program was simple and straight forward. Much like other email services once you have it downloaded you input your email account to connect to it. From there your emails from that account will display along with a social media style news feed. Other features available are calendar, and various other extension options. I noticed Thunderbird is very similar to the Microsoft Outlook program, however Thunderbird can be used with Mozilla Firefox. I did not know Mozilla had other programs available and it will be interesting to explore this further.</p>
