<h1>Assignment 8</h1>
<p>In activity three I learned the differences between multiple antivirus software and applications. After reviewing the comparison between the antivirus software, I downloaded the free Avast app to scan my system. My MacBook is relatively new, and I only use it for school work and nothing more. Upon completing the scan, it showed that my system is clean and no viruses or malware to report. This is very valuable information to know for the future as it shows the strengths and weaknesses to many name brand antivirus and antimalware software. The comparison chart will help make future choices on what software to use personally or to even recommend to people in the future.</p>
<p>Activity four taught me a lot about the different options available for password managers and multi-factor authentication. For my password manager I use Google as it is the main product I use for many things such as email and browser. It makes it easy to sign into my account and have my information ready in the new browser or email that I am using. Multi-factor authentication was actually a lot more common than I realized and used on almost every account I had. For my Microsoft account it has asked for a code from my cell phone after signing in order to continue, for my financial app it is tied to my face recognition on my iPhone, for my NBA app it is also face recognition. I did not realize it was so common and how many different accounts require an extra step to sign in.</p>
<p>Finally, in activity five I learned how to test my firewall using ShieldsUp. Prior to this I had not heard of ShieldsUp or that there was a way to test your firewall. Navigating through it was simple enough and there were warnings about data usage and disclosures that the site will not use or record any personal information. It checked the firewall of my MacBook and showed if there were any discrepancies which there was not. This is another useful tool to have in the future and be able to check the firewall status of a device.</p>
