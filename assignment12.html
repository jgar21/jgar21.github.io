<p>Assignment twelve allowed me to see what was missing or needed correction in my website. The Wave tool is very useful and provides alerts and error notifications for your website. Through this I adjusted a lot of the low contrast I had in my website. I did not realize the text font and background clashed a little bit due to the colors looking a little different to me pre application. That was what the Wave tool flagged as did WebAIM and I corrected them with color adjustments through CSS. These will be useful tools to use for the future to ensure that my websites will be optimal and without fault.</p>
